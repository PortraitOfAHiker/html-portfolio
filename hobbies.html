    <title>I SWEAR I HAVE HOBBIES OUTSIDE OF BACKPACKING</title>
</head>

    <h1>Mike's weird hobbies!</h1>
    <p>I love card magic. I started studying sleight of hand when I was about five years old. My library is extensive and my knowledge is deep, but I also have a lot of performing experience. I love the technical aspect of the card manipulation, but I also love the "softer" skills of the people control. One of my favorite moves is called a top change. It's literally just distracting the audience while you openly switch a chosen card in my right hand for the top card of the deck that's in my left hand. The only way this move works is with strong psychological suggestion.
    </p>
    <p>I also love photography. I started by taking thousands of pictures and comparing them to what I saw on instragram. Now I'm well-versed in the history of photography, a general history of creating art, the technical aspects of camera hardware, the mathematics of composition, and post-processing software. I've <i>developed</i> (get it?) from taking my first photos in 2020 to showing a photography guide in Denali how to troubleshoot an issue with cameras refusing to take long exposures.
    </p>
    <p>For something less dorky (maybe?), I also roll pasta and make my own pizza. I start from semolina flour or 00 flour and tomatoes and manually go through the entire process of making/rolling dough to adding homemade mozarella cheese.
    </p>
    <p>One last hobby for now: I like learning new things. With loose guidance from mentors, I studied manufacturing operations and the ideas behind efficiency: root cause analysis, industrial organization, economy of motion, just-in-time logistics, and more. Before that, I had an interest in craft beer. Through reading books, searching online, and talking to local professionals, I learned enough about the brewing process to become a certified beer judge. I got a job at a local brewery and worked my way from the host desk of the restaurant to the evening production manager's desk above the brewery. Through sheer force of will, I left dead-end jobs in warehousing to earn six figures in a manufacturing management. Then I didit again: I left manufacturing and carved out a niche for myself as a landscape and lifestyle photographer. Now that I have enough stability to afford a permanent residence, I have the the time to move to my next endeavor: web design. Squarespace is a disaster that borders on being purely a scam. My photography website is ugly as hell because Squarespace has pivoted from being the most powerful WYSIWYG editor to a GeoCities style mess, all so they can charge customers for advice and design help. <b>But whatever the insitgating idea, my next huge interest (and professional achievement) is to become a skilled full stack web developer.</b>
