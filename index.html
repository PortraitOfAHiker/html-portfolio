    <h1>Summary</h1>
    <p>This is Capstone Project #1 from Udemy. I'm studying full stack web development so I have a chance at a career that allows me to work remotely, project by project. I enjoy being a solitary wilderness hobo. A career in webdev would require more connectivity but would provide the resources to have frequent trips into the backcountry. Ideally, I'd like to work 4-8 months each year. I live a simple lifestyle, and it wouldn't take much to sustain me. Everything on my GitHub account is related to learning to be a proficient developer and making connections with more skilled developers and learning from other freelance workers.

    We haven't learned CSS yet so this picture is just shoved into the page for the sake of showing that I can add an image to the asset library, put it into a page, and control its size.
